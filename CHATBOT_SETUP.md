## ðŸš€ To Enable OpenAI API Integration

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable

Add to your `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Create API Endpoint

Create `pages/api/chat.ts` (or `app/api/chat/route.ts` for App Router):

```typescript
import { callOpenAI } from "@/api/chat";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { message } = await request.json();
    const response = await callOpenAI(message);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ response }), {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ error: "Failed to process message" }),
      {
        status: 500,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Enable API in ChatBot

In `client/components/ChatBot.tsx`, uncomment the API call section (lines ~85-95) and remove the local fallback.

## ðŸ’¡ Current Status

**Currently Running**: Local intelligent responses (no API key required)

## ðŸ“± User Experience

When users first open the chat:
